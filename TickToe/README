Title: Tic Tac Toe Game

Description:
This C++ program implements a simple command-line version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Two players, 'X' and 'O', take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbol wins the game. The program checks for a winner after each move and displays the winning player when the game ends.

Features:

Game Grid: The program displays a 3x3 grid representing the Tic Tac Toe board.
Player Input: Players input the number of the field they want to mark.
Winning Condition: The program checks for winning combinations after each move to determine the winner.
Player Turn: Players alternate turns between 'X' and 'O'.
Game Outcome: When a player wins, the program displays the winning player ('X' or 'O'). If the game ends in a tie, it notifies the players accordingly.
Instructions for Use:

Compilation: Compile the program using a C++ compiler. For example, you can use g++ on Unix-like systems or MinGW on Windows.
